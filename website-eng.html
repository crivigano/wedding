				<p>The venue is on a little mountain within a park, and the only way to reach it is by car. The venue has a big car park, which will be reserved for our guests. Please make sure to print and display <a href=>this ticket<a> to be allowed to the car park.</p>
				<p>Please note that taxis in Italy are really expensive, we therefore suggest hiring a car or using public transports to get as close as possible to the venue (the closest train station is Sala al Barro, which is on the train line that connects Lecco to Milano). </p>
				<p>
				The closest airport to the venue is Milan Malpensa. Milan Bergamo and Milan are also viable options and car hire and trains and buses are available from all three airports. </p>

				<p>The venue is located in Galbiate, which is a small town. If you want to take the occasion and make a holiday out of it, a good location can be Lecco <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/23900+Lecco,+Province+of+Lecco,+Italy/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x478402d32a793355:0x8f7caba70bc80602?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0uo-JsYzWAhUsKMAKHR1SCo0Q8gEIgQEwDQ" target="_blank">Lecco</a>. Lecco is a lovely town located on Lake Como. From here you can take a ferry to other towns on the lake (for example Bellagio or Varenna) or a train to other northern cities like Milano or Como.</p>
				<p>For the more adventurer ones, you can enjoy one of the many hikes, climbs or vie ferrate around the Alps nearby.</p>
