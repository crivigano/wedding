				<p>The venue is on a little mountain within a park, and the only way to reach it is by car. The venue has a big car park, which will be reserved for our guests. </p>
				<p>Please note that taxis in Italy are really expensive, therefore we suggest hiring a car or using public transport to get as close as possible to the venue (the closest train station is Sala al Barro, which is on the train line that connects Lecco to Milan). </p>
				<p>
				The closest airport to the venue is Milan Malpensa. However, Milan Bergamo and Milan Linate are also viable options and car hire and trains and buses are available from all three airports. </p>

				<p> The venue is located in Galbiate, which is a small town. If you want to make the most of your time in Italy and make a holiday out of it, a good location to stay in is Lecco. Lecco is a lovely town located on Lake Como. From here you can take a ferry to other towns on the lake (for example Bellagio or Varenna) or a train to other northern cities like Milan or Como.</p>
				<p>For the more adventurous, you can enjoy the many hikes, climbs or vie ferrate around the Alps nearby.</p>
				<p>There is also a hostel next to the venue, which is already fully booked on the Saturday night. However, should you wish to stay there on Friday night please contact them directly: <a href=http://www.ostelloparcobarro.it/en/>www.ostelloparcobarro.it</a>.</p>
